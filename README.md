This is a Movie website that features all the latest movies and trending movies.

The website is made using React.js, TMDB API, Appwrite Database.

The landing page of the website has Search Bar which is imported from Search.jsx into App.jsx, Below the search bar there is a Trending movies section which shows the top 5 most searched movies in the website this was done using the Appwrite Database that counts the number of searches for a movie and return them accordingly.

After that is the Movies Section in this section top movies are displayed according to the TMDB API. The Search feature of the website is optimized using DebounceSearch useEffect which decreases the API calls while searching for a movie.
